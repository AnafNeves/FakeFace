<!-- stakes and Post-truth era -->
For the first time in the history of humanity, technology has enabled the creation of near-perfect simulations indistinguishable from reality. These artificial yet realistic constructs permeate all areas of life through immersive works of fiction, deep fakes (real-like images and videos generated by deep learning algorithms), virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), artificial beings (artificial intelligence "bots" with or without a physical form), fake news and skewed narratives, of which ground truth is often hard to access [@nightingale2022]. Such progress not only carries important consequences for the technological and entertainment sectors, but also for security and politics, for instance if used for propaganda and disinformation, recruitment into malevolent organizations, or religious indoctrination [@pantserev2020]. This issue is central to what has been coined the "post-truth era" [@lewandowsky2017beyond], in which the distinction (and lack thereof) between authentic and simulated objects will play a critical role.

<!-- Ambiguous stimuli and irrelevance of objective features -->
While not all simulations have achieved perfect realism [e.g., Computer Generated Images - CGI in movies often lack certain key details that makes them visually distinct from real images, @mcdonnell2010face], it is fair to assume that these technical limitations will become negligible in the near future, in particular in the field of faces generation and replacement [@nightingale2022; @tucciarelli2020; @moshel2022]. This fact, however, leads to a new issue: if real and fake stimuli cannot be distinguished based on their objective characteristics, how can we make judgments regarding their nature?

<!-- Context -->
Literature shows that the context surrounding a stimulus often plays an important role in the assessment of its reality [a process henceforth referred to as *simulation monitoring*, @makowski2019phenomenal; @makowski2018cognitive]. With the extensive search and processing of cues within ambiguous stimuli being an increasingly complex and cognitively effortful strategy [@michael2021source; @susmann2021persuasion], people tend to draw on peripheral contextual cues (**Figure 1**), such as the source of the stimulus, and its credibility, authority and expertise, to help facilitate their evaluation [@petty1986elaboration; @susmann2021persuasion; @michael2021source]. However, the atomization and decontextualization of information allowed by online social media (where text snippets or video excerpts are mass-shared with little context) can render this task difficult [@berghel2018weaponizing; @chen2015news]. In the absence of contextual information, what drives our beliefs of reality? 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision to believe that an ambiguous stimulus (of any form, e.g., images, text, videos, environments, ...) is real or fake depends of individual characteristics (e.g., personality and cognitive styles), stimulus-related features (context, emotionality), and their interaction, which can manifest for instance in our bodily reaction.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Figure1.png")
```

<!-- Internal features -->
Moreover, evidence from research indicates that inter-individual characteristics also play a crucial role in the formation of beliefs of reality, with factors such as cognitive style, prior beliefs, and personality traits significantly impacting simulation monitoring [@bryanov2021determinants; @ecker2022psychological; @sindermann2020short]. For instance, individuals with higher levels of analytical reasoning have been found to better discriminate real from fake stimuli [@pehlivanoglu2021role; @pennycook2019lazy]. Prior knowledge or beliefs about the stimulus influences one's perception of it by biasing the attention deployment towards information in line with our expectations [@britt2019reasoned], and dispositional traits, such as high levels of narcissism and low levels of openness and conscientiousness, have been associated with greater susceptibility to fake news [@piksa2022cognitive; @sindermann2020short].


<!-- Reactive features -->
Beyond stimulus- and individual-related characteristics, evidence suggests that the interaction between the two, i.e., the subjective reaction associated with the experience of a given stimulus, contributes to simulation monitoring decisions. For instance, the intensity of experienced emotions have been shown to increase one's sense of presence in a simulated reality, i.e., the extent to which one feels like "being there", as if the movie or the VR environment was real [@sanchez2005presence; @makowski2017being], and beliefs that the stimuli were fake were found to result in emotion down-regulation [@makowski2019phenomenal; @sperduti2017distinctive]. In line with these findings, other studies on susceptibility to fake news have also found heightened stimulus emotionality to be associated  with greater belief [@martel2020reliance; @bago2022emotion]. Additionally, other factors, such as the stimulus' perceived self-relevance [@sperduti2016paradox; @goldstein2009pleasure], as well as familiarity [@begg1992dissociation], could also play a role in our processing and reaction to real as opposed to non-real material.


<!-- Attractiveness -->
AI-generated images of faces, due to their popularity as a target of CGI technology and the possibility of experimentally manipulating facial features, are increasingly used to study face processing as related to saliency or emotions, as well as to other important components of faces evaluation, such as trustworthiness or attractiveness [@sobieraj2014beautiful; @balas2017; @tsikandilakis2019beauty; @calbi2017]. Interestingly, some studies report that when the nature of the faces was ambiguous, artificially created faces that were previously rated as more attractive were judged by subjects to be less real [@tucciarelli2020]. However, as the attractiveness ratings were given by independent raters instead of the participants, the direction of the relationship between perceived realness and attractiveness cannot be concluded. To this end, @liefooghe2022faces reports that attractiveness ratings differed significantly between participants who were told that the faces were AI-generated from those who had no prior knowledge. Whereas this line of evidence suggests that beliefs of reality have an effect on attractiveness ratings of faces, the opposite question, whether attractiveness could drive beliefs of reality, has received little attention to date.


<!-- Goals and hypotheses -->
This study aims primarily at exploring the effect of face attractiveness on simulation monitoring, i.e., on the beliefs that an image is real or artificially generated. Based on the embodied reality theory [outlined in @makowski2018cognitive; @makowski2019phenomenal], which suggests that salient and emotional stimuli are perceived to be more real, we hypothesize a quadratic relationship between the perceived realness and attractiveness: faces rated as highly attractive or unattractive will more likely believed to be real. Moreover, we expect a similar relationship with trustworthiness ratings given its well-established link with attractiveness [@liefooghe2022faces; @bartosik2021you; @garrido2017kdef; @little2011facial], and a positive relationship with familiarity (as more familiar faces would appear as more salient, self-relevant and anchored in reality). Additionally, we will further explore the role of dispositional traits, such as personality and attitude towards AI, as well as characteristics of inter-individual simulation monitoring tendencies.

## Methods

In line with open-science standards, all the material (stimuli generation code, experiment code, raw data, analysis script with complementary figures and analyses, preregistration, etc.) is available at [**https://github.com/RealityBending/FakeFace**](https://github.com/RealityBending/FakeFace){.uri}.

### Procedure

109 photos of neutral-expression faces of real individuals were retrieved from the American Multiracial Face Database (AMFD, [@chen2021broadening]). In the first part of the study, participants answered a series of personality questionnaires. This includes the *Mini-IPIP6* [24 items, @sibley2011], to measure 6 "normal" personality traits (Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism and Honesty-Humility); the *FFNI-BF* [30 items, @jauk2022validation] to measure 9 facets of narcissism (acclaim-seeking, distrust, entitlement, exploitativeness, indifference, lack of empathy, manipulativeness, need for admiration and thrill-seeking); the *R-GPTS* [18 items, @freeman2021revised], to measure 2 sub-scales of paranoid thinking (persecution and reference ideation); the *IUS-12* [12 items, @carleton2007fearing], to assess beliefs about uncertainty and the future; the *SIAS-6* and the *SPS-6* [6 items each, @peters2012development], to assess social anxiety levels as well as a 10-item scale that measures participants general attitudes towards artificial intelligence (of which 5 items were adapted from the *GAAIS* [@schepman2020initial]). 

In the second part of this study, the set of facial images retrieved from the AMFD were presented to the participants for 500ms each, in a randomized order. Following each facial display, participants were asked to rate each face on its **Attractiveness** ("I find this person attractive"), **Beauty** ("This face is good-looking"), **Trustworthiness** ("I find this person trustworthy") and **Familiarity** ("This person reminds me of someone I know") using a visual analog scale.

In the last part of the study, participants were informed that half of the facial images previously seen were AI-generated. The same set of facial images displayed before were then presented for a second set of trials in a new randomized order. As per the first set, each facial stimuli was presented for 500ms. After each display, participants were asked to judge whether they thought the face they saw was real (or fake) using a visual analog scale. 

This experiment was implemented using *jsPsych* [@de2015jspsych], and the full set of instructions is available in the experiment code.


### Participants

103 participants were recruited via *Prolific* ([www.prolificacademic.co.uk](www.prolificacademic.co.uk)), a crowd-sourcing platform providing high data quality [@peer2022]. The only inclusion criterion was a fluent proficiency in English to ensure that the experiment instructions would be well-understood. Participants were incentivised with a reward of about \textsterling 7.5 for completing the study, which took about 50 minutes to finish. Demographic variables (age, gender, and ethnicity) were self-reported on a voluntary basis.

Upon inspection of stimuli ratings, attention check responses and total duration spent to complete the personality questionnaires, 3 participants were removed for spending an implausibly short time to finish the questionnaires and having very low correlations between their stimuli ratings and that of the normative distribution.

The final sample included 100 participants (Mean age = 27.9, SD = 8.5, range: [19, 66]; Sex: 48% females, 52% males).

### Data Analysis


The real-fake ratings (measured originally on a [-1, 1] analog scale) were converted into two scores, corresponding to two distinct mechanisms: the dichotomous *belief* (real or fake, derived based on the sign of the rating) and the *confidence* (the rating's absolute value) associated with that belief. Models predicting the former were set as logistic mixed models (with the participants and images entered as random factors), and models modeling the latter, as well as the other face ratings (attractiveness, beauty, trustworthiness and familiarity) were modeled using beta regression models (suited for an outcome variable expressed in percentages). 

We started by investigating the effect of the procedure and instructions to check whether the stimuli (which were real pictures of faces) were indeed judged as fake in a sufficient proportion to warrant their analysis. Additionally, we assessed the effect of the re-exposure delay, i.e., the time between the first presentation of the image (corresponding to the face ratings) and the second presentation (for the real-fake rating). 

The determinants of reality beliefs were modeled separately for attractiveness, beauty, trustworthiness, and familiarity, using second order raw polynomials coefficients to allow for possible quadratic relationships (**Figure 2**. Aside from attractiveness (conceptualized as a general construct), models for beauty, trustworthiness and familiarity were adjusted for the the two remaining variables *mutatis mutandis*. We took into account the gender of participants and stimuli by retaining the pictures that were aligned with the participants' sexual preference (e.g., female faces for homosexual females, male faces for heterosexual females, and both for bisexual participants), and modeling the interaction with the participants' gender. For the attractiveness and beauty models, we then added the interaction with the reported self-attractiveness (the average of the two questions pertaining to it) to investigate its potential modulatory effect.

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Figure2.png")
```

Finally, we investigated the inter-individual correlates of simulation monitoring by computing, for each participant, the proportion of faces judged as real (i.e., the overall bias towards one or the other belief), as well as the average confidence for faces judged as real, and fake. We assessed the link between these scores and dispositional traits using Bayesian correlation analysis [@makowski2019indices@; @correlationArticle]. 


The analysis was carried out using *R 4.2* [@RCoreTeam2022], the *tidyverse* [@wickham2019], and the *easystats* collection of packages [@insightArticle; @bayestestRArticle; @performanceArticle; @parametersArticle]. As all the details, scripts and complimentary analyses are available in open-access, the manuscript will focus on significant results.

## Results

### Manipulation Check

Only one image file yielded a strong simulation monitoring bias (> 85\%), being classified as fake in 87.4\% of trials. This image was removed from further analysis, leaving 108 trials per participant. On average, across participants, 44\% of images (95\% CI [0.11, 0.64]) were judged as fake and 56\% of images (95\% CI [0.36, 0.89]) as real. An intercept-only model with the participants and images as random factors showed that the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), which can be interpreted as the proportion of variance explained by the random factors, was of 10.5% for the participants and 8.7% for the pictures. 

There was a significant negative effect of the delay of re-exposure (with 95\% of values between 1.58 and 30.31 min), suggesting that shorter delays were associated with a slight bias towards the belief of reality (60\% at a theoretical delay of 0), which decreased to 50\% at a theoretical delay of 60 min ($OR = 0.99$, $95\% CI = [0.99, 1.00]$, $z = -2.27$, $p = .023$). There was also a significant negative effect on judgment confidence, but only in the real condition ($\beta = -0.005$, $95\% CI = [-0.1, 0.0]$, $p = .023$).


### Determinants of Simulation Monitoring

Attractiveness had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 2.8%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 16.37$, $95\% CI = [7.76, 24.98]$, $z = 3.73$, $p < .001$) for males, and a quadratic relationship for females ($\beta_{poly2} = 7.77$, $95\% CI = [1.41, 14.13]$, $z = 2.40$, $p = .017$), with both non-attractive and attractive faces being judged as more real. No significant relationship was found between attractiveness ratings and belief confidence, aside of a similar trend for females only, for faces judged as real ($\beta_{poly2} = 4.38$, $95\% CI = [0.96, 7.79]$, $z = 2.51$, $p = .012$). There was no interaction with reported self-attractiveness.

Beauty, adjusted for trustworthiness and familiarity, had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.5%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 9.54$, $95\% CI = [1.43, 17.65]$, $z = 2.31$, $p = .021$) for males only. No effect on confidence was found, aside from a quadratic relationship for females for faces judged as fake, suggesting that non-beautiful and highly beautiful faces were rated as fake with more confidence than average faces ($\beta_{poly2} = 6.61$, $95\% CI = [1.98, 11.24]$, $z = 2.80$, $p = .005$). There was no interaction with reported self-attractiveness.

Trustworthiness, adjusted for beauty and familiarity, had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.0%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 11.60$, $95\% CI = [4.15, 19.06]$, $z = 3.05$, $p = .002$) for females only. No effect on confidence was found, aside from a quadratic relationship for females for faces judged as real, suggesting that non-trustworthy and highly trustworthy faces were rated as real with more confidence than average faces ($\beta_{poly2} = 6.47$, $95\% CI = [1.73, 11.21]$, $z = 2.68$, $p = .007$).

We did not find any significant relationships for familiarity adjusted for beauty and trustworthiness ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.0%). However, a significant positive and linear relationship was found with the confidence in faces judged as real ($\beta_{poly1} = 9.31$, $95\% CI = [3.45, 15.17]$, $z = -3.11$, $p = .002$), and a quadratic relationship for faces judged as fake ($\beta_{poly1} = -12.67$, $95\% CI = [-19.87, -5.47]$, $z = -3.45$, $p < .001$; $\beta_{poly2} = 8.14$, $95\% CI = [0.01, 16.28]$, $z = 1.96$, $p = .05$), for males only, suggesting that faces judged as real with more confidence when they are familiar, and judged as fake with less confidence when they are of not familiar or highly familiar.

### Inter-Individual Correlates of Simulation Monitoring

Bayesian correlations with personality traits suggested that Honesty-Humility was negatively associated with the confidence in reality ($r = -0.21$, $95\% CI = [-0.38, -0.03]$, $BF_{10} = 3.57$), and positively associated with the Narcissism trait of Acclaim Seeking ($r = 0.26$, $95\% CI = [0.08, 0.43]$, $BF_{10} = 14.38$) and Grandiose Fantasies ($r = 0.22$, $95\% CI = [0.04, 0.40]$, $BF_{10} = 4.18$). Acclaim Seeking was also positively related with the confidence in fake judgments ($r = 0.22$, $95\% CI = [0.04, 0.40]$, $BF_{10} = 4.52$). No significant correlations was found for social anxiety, intolerance to uncertainty, or paranoid beliefs.

Questions pertaining to the attitude towards AI were reduced to 3 dimensions through factor analysis, labelled AI-Enthusiasm (loaded by items expressing interest and excitement in AI development and applications), AI-Realness (loaded by items expressing positive opinions on the ability of AI to create realistic material), and AI-Danger (loaded by items expressing concerns on the unethical misuse of AI technology). Only AI-Enthusiasm displayed a significant positive relationship with the confidence in both real ($r = 0.24$, $95\% CI = [0.06, 0.41]$, $BF_{10} = 8.00$) and fake ($r = 0.28$, $95\% CI = [0.11, 0.44]$, $BF_{10} = 23.04$) judgments.  

## Discussion

Notably, despite all the facial images being of real individuals retrieved from the same database, our results found every participant easily believed (to high degrees of confidence) that a significant proportion of them were fake. While this result is unsurprising, it is nevertheless a testimony to the existing expectations regarding CGI technology, as well as to the volatility of our sense of reality. In fact, stimuli-related and participant-related characteristics accounted for less than 20% of the variance in beliefs, suggesting that a large part of it is associated with other subjective processes.

### Attractiveness and Beauty (males -positive linear; females -quadratic(u-shape); judgement confidence positive quadratic relationship for females only in the real condition)

Although attractiveness did not seem to be the primary drive underlying simulation monitoring of facial images in the present study, it does nonetheless display an association. Furthermore, the positive quadratic relationship found between beliefs of realness and attractiveness for female participants is aligned with our hypothesis, that faces which are highly salient (i.e., perceived to be very attractive or very unattractive) are judged to be more real. Alternatively, the positive linear relationship between beauty and attractiveness, and beliefs of realness observed for males could have an evolutionary basis. In particular, males are widely postulated to place more importance toward facial attractiveness as a sign of reproductive potential, relative to females, who tend to value characteristics signaling resource acquisition capabilities [@qi2022gender]. As such, males could have perceived highly attractive and beautiful faces to be more real since such attractiveness act as salient cues of biological quality [@fink2006facial]. Therefore, our study suggests a more complex relationship between stimulus attractiveness, demographic variables and perceptions of reality that has not been examined in the literature. 

Moreover, beyond its impacts on individuals' beliefs about realness, attractiveness was found to significantly affect the confidence in judgements for females.


### trustworthiness 

In contrast to the findings for attractiveness, trustworthiness only positively predicted beliefs in realness for females. While we had expected a positive relationship between the two variables across both genders, this observation is also consistent with the evolutionary perspective, which suggests that females, relative to males, are more averse to risk-taking because it may compromise their reproductive potential [@van2020sex]. As such, given that low facial trustworthiness may signal greater risk, perceived trustworthiness may confer greater importance in predicting the perception of reality for females than males [@hou2019survival]. Interestingly, while several studies have found both possessing prior knowledge that faces were artificial and the perceived realness of virtual faces to be predictive of trustworthiness ratings (i.e., faces judged as real were rated as more trustworthy) [@liefooghe2022faces; @hoogers2021effect; @balas2017], the same cannot easily be said of the opposite direction; that is, trustworthiness does not seem to be a primary driver underlying the processes of simulation monitoring.  


### familiarity (confidence judgement; positive linear -real; quadratic -fake)
Contrary to our hypothesis, familiarity was not found to have any significant effects on simulation monitoring decisions.

### inter-indiv correlates (HH- negative with confidence in real; positive with acclaim-seeking and grandiose; Acc-seeking - positive with confidence in fake)


### AI attitudes (enthusiam - positive with confidence in both real and fake judgements)



### Re-exposure Delay 

Although the order of presentation of the facial images was randomized to reduce effects of adaptation, re-exposure delay was found to have a significant negative effect on simulation monitoring decisions, with shorter delays being associated with faces being rated as more real. Interestingly, while it could be posited that shorter delays led to the faces appearing more familiar and thereby increased people's belief in its realness, this seems unlikely considering perceived familiarity did not significantly affect simulation monitoring decisions made, even after controlling for attractiveness and trustworthiness. Alternatively, shorter re-exposure delays could have led to the faces being better remembered, thus triggering autobiographical memory processes [@gobbini2013prioritized] and evoking a sense of personal relevance during the repeated display. Indeed, fictional stimuli that were associated with more personal memories have been shown to up-regulate emotions [@sperduti2016paradox; @makowski2017being], thus biasing the realness of the given stimulus
