<!-- stakes and Post-truth era -->
For the first time in human history, technology has enabled the creation of near-perfect simulations indistinguishable from reality. These artificial, yet realistic constructs permeate all areas of life through immersive works of fiction, deep fakes (real-like images and videos generated by deep learning algorithms), virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), artificial beings (artificial intelligence "bots" with or without a physical form), fake news and skewed narratives, of which ground truth is often hard to access [@nightingale2022]. Such developments not only carry important consequences for the technological and entertainment sectors, but also for security and politics - for instance if used for propaganda and disinformation, recruitment into malevolent organizations, or religious indoctrination [@pantserev2020]. This issue is central to what has been coined the "post-truth era" [@lewandowsky2017beyond], in which the distinction (and lack thereof) between authentic and simulated objects will play a critical role.

<!-- Ambiguous stimuli and irrelevance of objective features -->
While not all simulations have achieved perfect realism [e.g., Computer Generated Images - CGI in movies often lack certain key details that makes them visually distinct from real images, @mcdonnell2010face], it is fair to assume that these technical limitations will become negligible in the near future, in particular in the field of face generation and replacement [@nightingale2022; @tucciarelli2020; @moshel2022]. This fact, however, leads to a new issue: if real and fake stimuli cannot be distinguished based on their objective characteristics, how can we make judgments regarding their nature?

<!-- Context -->
Literature shows that the context surrounding a stimulus often plays an important role in the assessment of its reality [a process henceforth referred to as *simulation monitoring*, @makowski2019phenomenal; @makowski2018cognitive]. With the extensive search and processing of cues within ambiguous stimuli being an increasingly complex and cognitively effortful strategy [@michael2021source; @susmann2021persuasion], people tend to draw on peripheral contextual cues (**Figure 1**), such as the source of the stimulus, and its credibility, authority and expertise, to help facilitate their evaluation [@petty1986elaboration; @susmann2021persuasion; @michael2021source]. However, the atomization and decontextualization of information allowed by online social media (where text snippets or video excerpts are mass-shared with little context) can render this task difficult [@berghel2018weaponizing; @chen2015news]. In the absence of contextual information, what drives our beliefs of reality?


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision to believe that an ambiguous stimulus (of any form, e.g., images, text, videos, environments, ...) is real or fake depends of individual characteristics (e.g., personality and cognitive styles), stimulus-related features (context, emotionality), and their interaction, which can manifest for instance in our bodily reaction.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Figure1.png")
```

<!-- Internal features -->
Moreover, evidence from research indicates that inter-individual characteristics also play a crucial role in the formation of beliefs of reality, with factors such as cognitive style, prior beliefs, and personality traits significantly impacting simulation monitoring [@bryanov2021determinants; @ecker2022psychological; @sindermann2020short]. For instance, individuals with higher levels of analytical reasoning have been found to better discriminate real from fake stimuli [@pehlivanoglu2021role; @pennycook2019lazy]. Prior knowledge or beliefs about the stimulus influences one's perception of it by biasing the attention deployment towards information that is in line with our expectations [@britt2019reasoned]. Furthermore, dispositional traits, such as high levels of narcissism and low levels of openness and conscientiousness, have been associated with greater susceptibility to fake news [@piksa2022cognitive; @sindermann2020short].


<!-- Reactive features -->
Beyond stimulus- and individual-related characteristics, evidence suggests that the interaction between the two (i.e., the subjective reaction associated with the experience of a given stimulus), contributes to simulation monitoring decisions. For instance, the intensity of experienced emotions have been shown to increase one's sense of presence - the extent to which one feels like "being there", as if the object of experience was real - when engaged in a fictional movie or a VR environment [@sanchez2005presence; @makowski2017being]. Conversely, beliefs that emotional stimuli were fake (e.g., that emotional scenes were not authentic but instead involved actors and movie makeup) were found to result in emotion down-regulation [@makowski2019phenomenal; @sperduti2017distinctive]. In line with these findings, studies on susceptibility to fake news have also found heightened stimulus emotionality to be associated  with greater belief [@martel2020reliance; @bago2022emotion]. Additionally, other factors, such as the stimuli's perceived self-relevance [@sperduti2016paradox; @goldstein2009pleasure], as well as familiarity [@begg1992dissociation], could also play a role in our processing and reaction to real as opposed to non-real material.


<!-- Attractiveness -->
AI-generated images of faces, due to their popularity as a target of CGI technology and the possibility of experimentally manipulating facial features, are increasingly used to study face processing as related to saliency or emotions, as well as to other important components of face evaluation, such as trustworthiness or attractiveness [@sobieraj2014beautiful; @balas2017; @tsikandilakis2019beauty; @calbi2017]. Interestingly, some studies report that when the nature of the faces was ambiguous, artificially created faces that were previously rated as more attractive were judged by subjects to be less real [@tucciarelli2020]. However, as the attractiveness ratings were given by independent raters instead of the participants, the direction of the relationship between perceived realness and attractiveness cannot be concluded. To this end, @liefooghe2022faces reports that attractiveness ratings differed significantly between participants who were told that the faces were AI-generated from those who had no prior knowledge. Whereas this line of evidence suggests that reality beliefs have an effect on face attractiveness ratings, the opposite question, whether attractiveness could drive simulation monitoring, has received little attention to date.


<!-- Goals and hypotheses -->
This study primarily aims at exploring the effect of facial attractiveness on simulation monitoring, i.e., on the beliefs that an image is real or artificially generated. Based on the embodied reality theory [outlined in @makowski2018cognitive; @makowski2019phenomenal], which suggests that salient and emotional stimuli are perceived to be more real, we hypothesize a quadratic relationship between perceived realness and attractiveness: faces rated as highly attractive or unattractive will more likely be believed to be real. We expect a similar relationship with trustworthiness ratings given its well-established link with attractiveness [@liefooghe2022faces; @bartosik2021you; @garrido2017kdef; @little2011facial], and a positive relationship with familiarity (as more familiar faces would appear as more salient, self-relevant and anchored in reality). Additionally, we will further explore the link of dispositional traits, such as personality and attitude towards AI, with inter-individual simulation monitoring tendencies. Note that the discriminative accuracy between "true" photos and "true" artificially-generated images is not relevant for this study, which focuses on the beliefs that a stimulus is real or fake, independently of its true nature.


## Methods

In line with open-science standards, all the material (stimuli generation code, experiment code, raw data, analysis script with complementary figures and analyses, preregistration, etc.) is available at [**https://github.com/RealityBending/FakeFace**](https://github.com/RealityBending/FakeFace){.uri}.

### Procedure

In the first part of the study, participants answered a series of personality questionnaires, including the *Mini-IPIP6* [24 items, @sibley2011] measuring 6 personality traits, the *SIAS-6* and the *SPS-6* [6 items each, @peters2012development] assessing social anxiety levels, the *FFNI-BF* [30 items, @jauk2022validation] measuring 9 facets of narcissism; the *R-GPTS* [18 items, @freeman2021revised] measuring 2 dimensions related to paranoid thinking; and the *IUS-12* [12 items, @carleton2007fearing] measuring intolerance to uncertainty. Self-rated attractiveness was also assessed using 2 items - one measuring general attractiveness ("How attractive would you say you are?", @marcinkowska2021self) and the other measuring physical attractiveness ("How would you rate your own physical attractiveness relative to the average", @spielmann2020predictive).  Finally, we devised 5 items pertaining to expectations about AI-generated image technology ("I think current Artificial Intelligence algorithms can generate very realistic images"). To lower their saliency and the possibility of it priming the subjects about the task, we mixed these items with 5 items from the general attitudes towards AI scale [*GAAIS*, @schepman2020initial]. This scale was presented after the social anxiety questionnaires. 3 attention check questions were also embedded in the surveys.

In the second part of this study, 109 pictures of neutral-expression faces from the validated American Multiracial Face Database (AMFD, [@chen2021broadening]) were presented to the participants for 500ms each, in a randomized order, following a fixation cross display (750 ms). After each stimulus presentation, ratings of *Trustworthiness* ("I find this person trustworthy") and *Familiarity* ("This person reminds me of someone I know") were collected using visual analog scales. Notably, as facial attractiveness is a multidimensional construct, encompassing evolutionary, sociocultural, biological as well as cognitive aspects [@rhodes2006evolutionary; @han2018beauty], we assessed attractiveness using 2 visual analog scales, measuring general *Attractiveness* ("I find this person attractive") and physical *Beauty* ("This face is good-looking").

In the last part of the study, participants were informed that about half of images previously seen were AI-generated (the instructions used a cover story which mentioned that the research was aimed at validating a new face generation algorithm). The same set of stimuli was displayed again for 500 ms in a new randomized order. This time, after each display, participants were asked to express their belief regarding the nature of the stimulus using a visual analog scale (with *Fake* and *Real* as the two extremes). The study was implemented using *jsPsych* [@de2015jspsych], and the exact instructions are available in the experiment code.

### Participants

One hundred and three participants were recruited via *Prolific*, a crowd-sourcing platform recognized for providing high quality data [@peer2022]. The only inclusion criterion was a fluent proficiency in English to ensure that the experiment instructions would be well-understood. Participants were incentivised with a reward of about \textsterling 7.5 for completing the study, which took about 45 minutes to finish. Demographic variables (age, gender, sexual orientation, education and ethnicity) were self-reported on a voluntary basis.

We excluded 3 participants that failed 2 (>= 66\%) or more attention check questions. The final sample included 100 participants (Mean age = 27.9, SD = 8.5, range: [19, 66]; Sex: 48\% females, 52\% males).

### Data Analysis


The real-fake ratings (measured originally on a [-1, 1] analog scale) were converted into two scores, corresponding to two conceptually distinct mechanisms: the dichotomous *belief* (real or fake, derived based on the sign of the rating) and the *confidence* (the rating's absolute value) associated with that belief. The former was analyzed using logistic mixed models (with the participants and images entered as random factors), which modeled the probability of assigning a face to the real (>= 0) as opposed to fake (< 0). The latter, as well as the other face ratings (attractiveness, beauty, trustworthiness and familiarity), was modeled using beta regressions (suited for outcome variables expressed in percentages).

We started by investigating the effect of the procedure and instructions to check whether the stimuli (which were all images of real faces) were judged as fake in sufficient proportion to warrant their analysis. Additionally, we assessed the effect of the re-exposure delay, i.e., the time between the first presentation of the image (corresponding to the face ratings) and the second presentation (for the real-fake rating).

The determinants of reality beliefs were modeled separately for attractiveness, beauty, trustworthiness, and familiarity, using second order raw polynomials coefficients to allow for possible quadratic relationships (**Figure 2**). Aside from attractiveness (conceptualized as a general construct), models for beauty, trustworthiness and familiarity were adjusted for the the two remaining variables *mutatis mutandis*. We took into account the gender of participants and stimuli by retaining the stimuli that were aligned with the participants' sexual preference (e.g., female faces for homosexual females, male faces for heterosexual females, and both for bisexual participants), and modeling the interaction with the participants' gender. For the attractiveness and beauty models, we then added the interaction with the reported self-attractiveness (the average of the two questions pertaining to it) to investigate its potential modulatory effect. Finally, we investigated the inter-individual correlates of simulation monitoring with similar models (but this time, for all items regardless of the participant's gender or sexual orientation) for each questionnaire, with all of the subscales as orthogonal predictors.

The analysis was carried out using *R 4.2* [@RCoreTeam2022], the *tidyverse* [@wickham2019], and the *easystats* collection of packages [@insightArticle; @bayestestRArticle; @performanceArticle; @parametersArticle; @correlationArticle]. As all the details, scripts and complimentary analyses are open-access, the manuscript will focus on significant results.

## Results

### Manipulation Check

Only one image file yielded a strong simulation monitoring bias (> 85\%), being classified as fake in 87.4\% of trials. This image was removed from further analysis, leaving 108 trials per participant. On average, across participants, 44\% of images (95\% CI [0.11, 0.64]) were judged as fake and 56\% of images (95\% CI [0.36, 0.89]) as real. An intercept-only model with the participants and images as random factors showed that the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), which can be interpreted as the proportion of variance explained by the random factors, was of 10.5% for the participants and 8.7% for the stimuli.

There was a significant negative effect of the delay of re-exposure (with 95\% of values between 1.58 and 30.31 min), suggesting that shorter delays were associated with a slight bias towards the belief of reality (60\% at a theoretical delay of 0), which decreased to 50\% at a theoretical delay of 60 min ($OR = 0.99$, $95\% CI = [0.99, 1.00]$, $z = -2.27$, $p = .023$). There was also a significant negative effect on judgment confidence, but only in the real condition ($\beta = -0.005$, $95\% CI = [-0.1, 0.0]$, $p = .023$).


### Determinants of Simulation Monitoring

Attractiveness had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 2.8%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 16.37$, $95\% CI = [7.76, 24.98]$, $z = 3.73$, $p < .001$) for males, and a quadratic relationship for females ($\beta_{poly2} = 7.77$, $95\% CI = [1.41, 14.13]$, $z = 2.40$, $p = .017$), with both non-attractive and attractive faces being judged as more real. No significant relationship was found between attractiveness ratings and belief confidence, aside of a similar trend for females only, for faces judged as real ($\beta_{poly2} = 4.38$, $95\% CI = [0.96, 7.79]$, $z = 2.51$, $p = .012$). There was no interaction with reported self-attractiveness.

Beauty, adjusted for trustworthiness and familiarity, had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.5%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 9.54$, $95\% CI = [1.43, 17.65]$, $z = 2.31$, $p = .021$) for males only. No effect on confidence was found, aside from a quadratic relationship for females for faces judged as fake, suggesting that non-beautiful and highly beautiful faces were rated as fake with more confidence than average faces ($\beta_{poly2} = 6.61$, $95\% CI = [1.98, 11.24]$, $z = 2.80$, $p = .005$). There was no interaction with reported self-attractiveness.

Trustworthiness, adjusted for beauty and familiarity, had a significant positive and linear relationship ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.0%) with the belief that a stimulus was real ($\beta_{poly1} = 11.60$, $95\% CI = [4.15, 19.06]$, $z = 3.05$, $p = .002$) for females only. No effect on confidence was found, aside from a quadratic relationship for females for faces judged as real, suggesting that non-trustworthy and highly trustworthy faces were rated as real with more confidence than average faces ($\beta_{poly2} = 6.47$, $95\% CI = [1.73, 11.21]$, $z = 2.68$, $p = .007$).

We did not find any significant relationships for familiarity adjusted for beauty and trustworthiness ($R^2_{marginal}$ = 3.0%). However, a significant positive and linear relationship was found with the confidence in faces judged as real ($\beta_{poly1} = 9.31$, $95\% CI = [3.45, 15.17]$, $z = -3.11$, $p = .002$), and a quadratic relationship for faces judged as fake ($\beta_{poly1} = -12.67$, $95\% CI = [-19.87, -5.47]$, $z = -3.45$, $p < .001$; $\beta_{poly2} = 8.14$, $95\% CI = [0.01, 16.28]$, $z = 1.96$, $p = .05$), for males only, suggesting that faces are judged as real with more confidence when they are familiar, and judged as fake with less confidence when they are not familiar or highly familiar.

### Inter-Individual Correlates of Simulation Monitoring

The models including the personality traits suggested that *Honesty-Humility* had a significant negative relationship predominantly with the confidence associated with faces judged as real ($\beta_{real} = -1.69$, $95\% CI = [-2.74, -0.63]$, $z = -3.14$, $p < .01$; $\beta_{fake} = -1.02$, $95\% CI = [-2.07, 0.03]$, $z = -1.90$, $p = 0.058$). Narcissism shared significant links through various dimensions, such as positive relationship between the confidence for both real and fake judgments and *Acclaim Seeking* ($\beta_{real} = 2.08$, $95\% CI = [0.79, 3.37]$, $z = 3.16$, $p < .01$; $\beta_{fake} = 1.60$, $95\% CI = [0.30, 2.90]$, $z = 2.42$, $p < .05$), and a negative relationship with *Authoritativeness* ($\beta_{real} = -1.38$, $95\% CI = [-2.50, -0.27]$, $z = -2.43$, $p < .05$; $\beta_{fake} = -1.23$, $95\% CI = [-2.35, -0.11]$, $z = -2.15$, $p < .05$) and *Thrill Seeking* ($\beta_{real} = -0.93$, $95\% CI = [-1.75, -0.10]$, $z = -2.20$, $p < .05$; $\beta_{fake} = -1.03$, $95\% CI = [-1.87, -0.20]$, $z = -2.44$, $p < .05$). Finally, the social phobia dimension was significantly associated with a decreased probability of judging faces as fake ($\beta = -0.97$, $95\% CI = [-1.86, -0.08]$, $z = -2.14$, $p < .05$), but no effect on the confidence judgments was found. No significant relationships were found for intolerance to uncertainty or paranoid beliefs.

<!-- Bayesian correlations with personality traits suggested that Honesty-Humility was negatively associated with the confidence in reality ($r = -0.21$, $95\% CI = [-0.38, -0.03]$, $BF_{10} = 3.57$), and positively associated with the Narcissism trait of Acclaim Seeking ($r = 0.26$, $95\% CI = [0.08, 0.43]$, $BF_{10} = 14.38$) and Grandiose Fantasies ($r = 0.22$, $95\% CI = [0.04, 0.40]$, $BF_{10} = 4.18$). Acclaim Seeking was also positively related with the confidence in fake judgments ($r = 0.22$, $95\% CI = [0.04, 0.40]$, $BF_{10} = 4.52$). No significant correlations was found for social anxiety, intolerance to uncertainty, or paranoid beliefs. -->

Questions pertaining to the attitude towards AI were reduced to 3 dimensions through factor analysis, labelled AI-Enthusiasm (loaded by items expressing interest and excitement in AI development and applications), AI-Realness (loaded by items expressing positive opinions on the ability of AI to create realistic material), and AI-Danger (loaded by items expressing concerns on the unethical misuse of AI technology). Only AI-Enthusiasm displayed a significant positive relationship with the confidence in both real and fake judgments ($\beta_{real} = 0.29$, $95\% CI = [0.08, 0.50]$, $z = 2.74$, $p < .01$; $\beta_{fake} = 0.38$, $95\% CI = [0.18, 0.59]$, $z = 3.60$, $p < 0.001$).


<!-- Only AI-Enthusiasm displayed a significant positive relationship with the confidence in both real ($r = 0.24$, $95\% CI = [0.06, 0.41]$, $BF_{10} = 8.00$) and fake ($r = 0.28$, $95\% CI = [0.11, 0.44]$, $BF_{10} = 23.04$) judgments. -->

## Discussion

This study aimed at investigating the effect of facial ratings (attractiveness, beauty, trustworthiness and familiarity) on simulation monitoring, i.e., on the belief that the stimulus is artificially generated. The most striking result, in our opinion, is that despite all the stimuli being real faces from the same database, all participants, when given the information, believed (to high degrees of confidence) that a significant proportion of them were fake. This finding is a testimony to both the current expectations regarding CGI technology in the population, as well as to the volatility of our sense of reality. It underlines the strong impact of prior expectations and information on reality beliefs. In fact, stimuli-related and participant-related characteristics accounted for less than 20\% of the beliefs variance, suggesting that a large part of it is associated with other subjective processes.

<!-- Attractiveness: females -->
Although attractiveness did not seem to be the primary drive underlying simulation monitoring of face images, we do nonetheless report significant associations, with a different pattern observed depending on the participant's gender. The quadratic relationship found for female participants is aligned with our hypothesis that salient faces (i.e., rated as very attractive or very unattractive) are judged to be more real. The fact that this effect did not reach significance for beauty underlines that attractiveness judgment, and its role in simulation monitoring, is a multidimensional construct that cannot be reduced to physical facial attractiveness, in particular for women [@buunk2002age; @qi2022gender].

<!-- Attractiveness: males -->
Indeed, we found a significant positive linear relationship in male participants for both attractiveness and beauty on simulation monitoring, that we could interpret under an evolutionary lens. Specifically, males purportedly place more emphasis on facial attractiveness as a sign of reproductive potential, as compared with females, who tend to value characteristics signaling resource acquisition capabilities [@qi2022gender; @fink2006facial; @buunk2002age]. However, while it is possible that the evolutionary weight associated with attractiveness skewed the perceived saliency towards attractive faces, rendering them significantly more salient than unattractive faces and in turn distorted the relationship with simulation monitoring, future studies should test this saliency-based hypothesis by measuring constructs closer to salience and its effects, for instance using neuroimaging [@lou2015perceptual; @indovina2007dissociation] or physiological markers [in particular, heart rate deceleration, @skora2022functional].


<!-- even after adjusting for the effects of trustworthiness and familiarity; both characteristics that are evolutionarily advantageous [@hou2019survival; @little2011facial]. A -->


<!-- trustworthiness -->
Our results suggested that trustworthiness ratings linearly increased beliefs in realness for females only. Given the evidence suggesting that faces presented as real were rated as more trustworthy [@liefooghe2022faces; @hoogers2021effect; @balas2017], we expected such a link to be present for both genders. One of the underlying mechanisms that possibly contributed to this dimorphism could have been the increased risk-taking aversion reported in females [explained evolutionarily as a compromise to their reproductive potential, @van2020sex], to which perceived facial trustworthiness relates [@hou2019survival]. However, if that was the case, faces judged as highly untrustworthy should have appeared as even more salient (representing an evolutionary threat), and hence be judged as more real. As such, further studies are needed to investigate the causes of the increased simulation monitoring sensitivity to trustworthiness in females.


<!-- familiarity -->
Contrary to our hypothesis, familiarity was not found to be significantly related to simulation monitoring decisions. However, it is to be noted that the distribution of familiarity ratings was strongly skewed, and only a low number of pictures was rated as highly familiar. Future studies should clarify this point by experimentally manipulating familiarity, for instance by modulating the amount of exposure to items before querying the simulation monitoring judgments.



<!-- inter-indiv correlates -->
Regarding the role of inter-individual characteristics in simulation monitoring tendencies, we found that participants with higher scores of honesty-humility, a trait related to an increased risk perception and aversion [@levidi2022understanding; @weller2012honest], displayed a lower confidence in their simulation monitoring judgments. Given the negative correlation between honesty-humility and narcissism [@hodson2018dark], we put this result in perspective with the positive link observed with narcissistic acclaim seeking, confirming the evidence regarding the relationship between narcissistic grandiosity and over-confidence in decision-making [@campbell2004narcissism; @chatterjee2017master; @brunell2017narcissism; @o2021grandiose]. However, an inverse effect was found for other facets of narcissism, such as authoritativeness and thrill seeking. We interpret the effects of the former as related to a higher response assertiveness and, for thrill-seeking, a tolerance of cognitive uncertainty (note that the intolerance to uncertainty scale, which largely measures the anxiety associated with uncertain events, did not show any link). Taken together, these results suggest that participants with low humility, high recognition desires, and high excitement-seeking traits are more confident in their judgment regarding the real or fake nature of ambiguous stimuli. Participants with opposite traits might perceive a higher risk in the decision process and its potential consequences (e.g., being seen as bad at the task at hand), resulting in more conservative confidence ratings.


<!-- AI attitudes -->
Despite the ubiquity of AI, the literature pertaining to the influence of people's AI attitudes on simulation monitoring is scarce. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence for the role of participants' expectations regarding the capabilities of AI technology (in terms of the realism of its productions). Instead, we found that one's enthusiasm about AI technology was related to an increased confidence in simulation monitoring ratings. It is possible that participants with a highly positive attitude towards AI perceive themselves as having greater knowledge about AI and its capabilities [@said2022artificial], hence permitting themselves to be more confident in their simulation monitoring decisions. This result is in line with reports that AI attitudes interacts with people's perceived self-knowledge to influence their perception of the opportunities and risks accorded by AI applications [@@said2022artificial]. 

<!-- Social phobia -->
However, it is important to note that all of the aforementioned dispositional traits did only influence the confidence judgments, but not the simulation monitoring bias *per se*. In fact, the only trait that modulated the tendency to rate an image as fake or real was the social phobia score, whereby low values were associated with an increased tendency to judge faces as real. Social phobia being characterized as a heightened fear in social interaction contexts [@kolassa2006psychophysiological; @ran2017impact], the nature of the stimuli - pictures of faces - could play a role in this association. However, given the fact that neutral faces are perceived as more threatening by participants with high social phobia [@yoon2008interpreting; @staugaard2010threatening; @peschard2017overestimation], and thus likely more salient, we would have expected high social phobia tendencies to be associated with a bias towards reality judgment. This apparent contradiction could be explained through the lens of fictional reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy in which the belief that an emotional stimulus is not real is used as a mean to down-regulate the associated emotional reactions [@sperduti2017distinctive; @sperduti2016paradox; @singer2021cognitive]. Moreover, this result is in line with prior findings suggesting that the likelihood of reality beliefs decreased when pictures were emotional, as compared to when they were neutral [@makowski2016phenomenal]. **TODO: can you double check that this last statement is correct?**. Future studies should clarify the role of emotions and attempt at delineating processes related to emotion perception and reaction from emotion regulation.


<!-- Re-exposure Delay -->
On a methodological level, although the order of presentation of the facial images was randomized to reduce effects of adaptation, a shorter re-exposure delay was associated with an increased likelihood of judging the faces as real. This may be because shorter re-exposure delays could have led to the faces being better remembered and appearing more familiar than faces that were displayed after a longer delay, thereby triggering self-referential and autobiographical memory processing during the repeated display [@abraham2009reality; @gobbini2013prioritized; @taylor2009neural]. Although the distribution variance in re-exposure delay is small, recent research using event-related brain potentials report representations of faces to be qualitatively similar regardless of the degree and type of familiarity (e.g., personal or media-based), only distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar faces [@wiese2021familiarity]. Moreover, fictional stimuli has been shown to up-regulate emotions when associated with familiarity [@sperduti2016paradox; @makowski2017being], thus biasing its salience and perceived realness. Future studies could hence further investigate the modulatory effects of types and degrees of familiarity on perceived realness judgements.


In conclusion, research on our ability to discriminate between what is real from what is not is increasingly relevant given the current expansion on technologies related to virtual and augmented realities. The aim of the present study was to examine whether facial attractiveness can significantly influence our simulation monitoring decisions. In line with our hypothesis, we found faces rated as attractive and unattractive to be perceived as more real for females as a result of an increased salience. However, for males, the observation of a positive linear relationship between attractiveness and beauty with simulation monitoring decisions, adjusted for evolutionarily advantageous features such as trustworthiness, suggest a more complex relationship than hypothesized. As such, future studies could further investigate the role of attractiveness in simulation monitoring, taking greater consideration of the former's multidimensionality.
