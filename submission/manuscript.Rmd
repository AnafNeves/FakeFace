<!-- Objective features -->
Technology allows already to create near-perfect simulations indistinguishable from reality. If real and fake stimuli are identical based on their objective characteristics, how can we make - hopefully accurate - judgments regarding their nature?

<!-- Context -->
Literatue shows that context surrounding stimuli plays an important role. But in the absence of context, what drives the beliefs of reality? 

<!-- Internal features -->
Psychological factors. Stable dispositional traits. Reactive characteristics.
