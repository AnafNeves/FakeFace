<!-- stakes and Post-truth era -->
For the first time in the history of humanity, technology has enabled the creation of near-perfect simulations indistinguishable from reality. These artificial yet realistic constructs permeate all areas of life through immersive works of fiction, deep fakes (real-like images and videos generated by deep learning algorithms), virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), artificial beings (artificial intelligence "bots" with or without a physical form), fake news and skewed narratives, of which ground truth is often hard to access [@nightingale2022]. Such progress not only carries important consequences for the technological and entertainment sectors, but also for security and politics, for instance if used for propaganda and disinformation, recruitment into malevolent organizations, or religious indoctrination [@pantserev2020]. This issue is central to what has been coined the "post-truth era" [@lewandowsky2017beyond], in which the distinction (and lack thereof) between authentic and simulated objects will play a critical role.

<!-- Ambiguous stimuli and irrelevance of objective features -->
While not all simulations have achieved perfect realism [e.g., Computer Generated Images - CGI in movies often lack certain key details that makes them visually distinct from real images, @mcdonnell2010face], it is fair to assume that these technical limitations will become negligible in the near future, in particular in the field of faces generation and replacement [@nightingale2022; @tucciarelli2020; @moshel2022]. This fact, however, leads to a new issue: if real and fake stimuli cannot be distinguished based on their objective characteristics, how can we make judgments regarding their nature?

<!-- Context -->
Literature shows that the context surrounding a stimulus often plays an important role in the assessment of its reality [a process henceforth referred to as *simulation monitoring*, @makowski2019phenomenal; @makowski2018cognitive]. The extensive search and processing of cues within ambiguous stimuli being an increasingly complex and cognitively effortful strategy [@michael2021source; @susmann2021persuasion], people tend to draw on peripheral contextual cues (**Figure 1**), such as the source of the stimulus, and its credibility, authority and expertise, to help facilitate their evaluation [petty1986elaboration; @susmann2021persuasion; @michael2021source]. However, the atomization and decontextualization of information allowed by online social media (where text snippets or video excerpts are mass-shared with little context) can render this task difficult. In the absence of contextual information, what drives our beliefs of reality? 


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The decision to believe that an ambiguous stimulus (of any form, e.g., images, text, videos, environments, ...) is real or fake depends of individual characteristics (e.g., personality and cognitive styles), stimulus-related features (context, emotionality), and their interaction, which can manifest for instance in our bodily reaction.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Figure1.png")
```

<!-- Internal features -->
The evidence shows that inter-individual characteristics play a role in the formation of beliefs of reality, with factors such as cognitive style, prior beliefs, and personality traits significantly impacting simulation monitoring [@bryanov2021determinants; @ecker2022psychological; @sindermann2020short]. For instance, individuals with higher levels of analytical reasoning have been found to better discriminate real from fake stimuli [@pehlivanoglu2021role; @pennycook2019lazy]. Prior knowledge or beliefs about the stimulus influences one's perception of it by biasing the attention deployment towards information in line with our expectations [@britt2019reasoned], and dispositional traits, such as high levels of narcissism and low levels of openness and conscientiousness, have been associated with greater susceptibility to fake news [@piksa2022cognitive; @sindermann2020short].


<!-- Reactive features -->
Beyond stimulus- and individual-related characteristics, evidence suggests that the interaction between the two, i.e., the subjective reaction associated with the experience of a given stimulus, contributes to simulation monitoring decisions. For instance, the intensity of experienced emotions have been shown to increase the sense of presence, i.e., the extent to which one feels like "being there", as if the movie or the VR environment was real [@sanchez2005presence; @makowski2017being], and beliefs that the stimuli were fake led to emotion down-regulation [@makowski2019phenomenal; sperduti2017distinctive]. However, @martel2020reliance reported that heightened stimulus emotionality was associated with greater belief in fake, but not real, information. Other factors, such as the stimulus' perceived self-relevance [@sperduti2016paradox; @goldstein2009pleasure], as well as familiarity  [@begg1992dissociation], could also play a role in our processing and reaction to real vs. non-real material.


<!-- Attractiveness -->
Images of faces, one of the most common artificial intelligence (AI) targets, integrate components of emotional reaction, salience, self-relevance via attractiveness (REF). Talk about possible links between attractiveness and simulation monitoring

## Methods

### Procedure

### Participants

### Data Analysis

The real-fake ratings were converted into two scores.

## Results

The analysis was carried out using *R 4.2* [**REF**], the *tidyverse* [**REF**], and the *easystats* collection of packages [**REFs for insight, parameters, performance, see**].

### Manipulation Check

Only one image file, classified as fake in 87.4\% of trials, yielded a strong simulation monitoring bias (> 85\%). This image was removed from further analysis (leaving 108 trials per participant). On average, across participants, 44\% of trials (95\% CI [0.11, 0.64]) was considered fake and 56\% of trials (95\% CI [0.36, 0.89]) was considered real.

There was a significant negative effect of the delay of re-exposure (with 95\% of values between 1.58 and 30.31 min), suggesting that shorter delays were associated with a slight bias towards the belief of reality (60\% at a theoretical delay of 0), which decreased to 50\% at a theoretical delay of 60 min ($OR = 0.99$, $95\% CI = [0.99, 1.00]$ $z = -2.27$, $p = 0.023$). There was also a significant negative effect on judgment confidence, but only in the real condition ($\beta = -0.005$, $95\% CI = [-0.1, 0.0]$, $p = .023$).


### Determinants of Simualtion Monitoring

## Discussion

Although expected, the first striking result is that despite all items being real photos from the same database, all people easily believe (to high degrees of confidence) that a significant proportion of them was fake. This is a testimony to the existing expectations regarding CGI technology, as much as to the volatility of our sense of reality.
